/// Solves Project Euler Problem 45: Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal.
/// Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the formulae:
/// Triangle    T_n = n(n+1)/2     1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
/// Pentagonal  P_n = n(3n−1)/2    1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
/// Hexagonal   H_n = n(2n−1)      1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...
/// It is found that T_285 = P_165 = H_143 = 40755.
/// The problem asks to find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

    /// All hexagonal numbers H_i are also triangular numbers T_{2i-1}.
    /// So, the method can iterate through hexagonal numbers H_i (for i > <paramref name="previousHexagonalIndex"/>)

    /// Current State & Workaround:
    /// - The call to `Library.IsPentagon(hex)` is currently commented out with a TODO note,
    ///   indicating a potential environment issue or an incomplete implementation of that library function.
    /// - A dummy condition (`iterations > 10`) and a placeholder return (`return hex;`) have been
    ///   added to make the method syntactically valid and terminate.
    /// - **Due to this workaround, the method in its current state does NOT correctly find the next TPH number.**
    ///   It will return a hexagonal number after a fixed number of iterations.
